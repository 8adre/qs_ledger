# Quantified Self (QS) Ledger

## A Personal Data Aggregator and Dashboard for Quantified Self

[Quantfied Self (QS) Ledger](https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger) helps aggregate and visualize your personal data. 

The project has two primary goals: 

1. download, aggregate and store locally all of your personal data from various tracking services (see below for list of integration services)
2. provide the starting point for creating a personal data dashboard for data analysis, data visualization, and predictive analysis and forecasting using Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence. 

At present, the main objective is to provide working data downloaders and simple data analysis for each of the integrated services. 

### Code / Dependencies: 

* The code is written in Python 3 and shared via Jupyter Notebooks for ease of reusability. 
* See individual service for specifics on installation and setup. 
* Most services depend on Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation and Matplot and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization. 
* Each project has a NAME_donwloader and NAME_data_analysis.  

### Current Integrations: 

* Apple Health (coming soon!)
* [Fitbit](https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger/tree/master/fitbit): fitness and health tracking and analysis of Steps, Sleep, and Heart Rate from a Fitbit wearable. 
* [Last.fm](https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger/tree/master/last_fm): : music tracking and analysis of music listening history from Last.fm.
* RescueTime (coming soon!)
